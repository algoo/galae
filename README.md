## Update existing installation for wildcard aliases support

The wildcard aliases support introduced in [this PR](https://github.com/algoo/galae/pull/5) requires a database schema update for existing mailcow installations. For the moment, this need
to be done manually. Below is a (very) succinct explanation:

- connect to the MySQL mailcow database
- run the following SQL commands:

```SQL
ALTER TABLE alias ADD COLUMN is_wildcard tinyint(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0' AFTER public_comment;
ALTER TABLE domain ADD COLUMN allow_wildcard_aliases tinyint(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0' AFTER relay_unknown_only;
```
